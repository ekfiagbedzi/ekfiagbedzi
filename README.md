# <Welcome to  my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹>

My name is Emmanuel Fiagbedzi and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at the Straquadanio lab, University of Edinburgh. In my current role I leverage advanced frameworks such as PyTorch and Nextflow to design generative AI models that capture the essential features of the protein alpha-galactosidaseâ€”an enzyme implicated in Fabryâ€™s disease. These models compactly and effectively represent protein sequences, enabling the generation of new proteins that preserve or enhance the functional and structural properties of the original enzyme, such as improved stability or specific binding affinities. This work aims to advance enzyme replacement therapies for Fabryâ€™s disease, demonstrating my ability to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to meaningful scientific challenges.
