### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel Kwasi Fiagbedzi and I am a PhD candidate in Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh. Over the past few years, I have developed a passion for AI/Data Engineering eventhough I have a background in the biological sciences because I realised that I love to automtate tasks to solve problems. Due to this, I enrolled in an AI engineering course at the AICore, where I am learning how to develop AI systems, which includes but not limited to deep learning, data processing, data acquisition, data cleaning and manipulation, CI/CD and cloud engineering.

My main skill sets include;
* Python *
* R *
* Machine Learning *
* Deep Learning (Pytorch) *

This page contains all the projects I have worked on alone as well as my collaborations
