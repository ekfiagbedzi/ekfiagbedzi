# <Welcome to  my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹>

My name is Emmanuel Fiagbedzi and I am a PhD candidate in Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh. Recently, I have developed a passion for AI Engineering eventhough I have a background in the biological sciences because I realised that I love to automtate tasks to solve problems. Due to this, I enrolled in an AI engineering course at the AICore, where I am learning how to develop AI systems, which includes but not limited to deep learning, data processing, data acquisition, data cleaning and manipulation and cloud engineering.

Skills;
* **Python**
* **R**
* **Machine Learning**
* **Deep Learning**
* **CI/CD Pipeline**
