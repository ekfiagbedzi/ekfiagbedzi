# <Welcome to  my GitHub page 👋>

I’m Emmanuel Fiagbedzi, a Machine Learning Engineer with experience developing end-to-end ML and generative AI systems for protein engineering, structural biology, and drug-discovery applications.

I currently work as a Computational Biologist (AI Models) at GSK Unlimited, where I design, fine-tune and deploy foundation models, transformer architectures, and generative AI methods for protein interaction modelling and structure-based discovery workflows. My role includes adapting and extending protein-structure ML models, building pipelines for large-scale PPI analysis, and delivering optimized models and datasets to GCP Vertex AI and BigQuery environments.
